Welcome to the first podcast from Open Lab, an interaction design and human-computer-interaction design lab based in the School of Computing in Newcastle University.

As an HCI lab we have been attending CHI for a number of years, and we decided to sit down with a few of our PhD students and Early Career Researchers who are presenting at CHI to talk about their work, what they are looking forward to, and if they have any tips for CHI newcomers.
