When our institutionâ€™s websites are unable to pass basic accessibility tests what does that mean for digital inclusion? In this conversation we bring together two Adams and a Richard - Open Lab PhD student [Adam Parnaby](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/adam-parnaby/), Adam Hill from Sunderland Software City and [Richard Boggie](https://twitter.com/reb_678) from VONNE - to talk about how we need to change the way we think about digital inclusion, and begin to consider if the gaps in knowledge lie with the digitally excluded or the people designing digital?
