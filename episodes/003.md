We sat down to chat with two students from our MSc in Human Computer Interaction Diksha Sharma and Joseph Hutchinson.

Diksha is currently about to finish the course and Joseph graduated last year, and is currently doing a PhD in Open Lab. Interested in studying HCI? Then this honest chat will give you everything you need to know about doing an Masters in HCI from the highs to the struggles. Learn about the cool things our students made on the course, how they balanced it with life and work and what life beyond the Masters can look like.
