## Welcome

Join us as we talk all things HCI and Interaction Design in the new Open Lab podcast.

Open Lab is a Human-Computer Interaction lab based at the School of Computing in Newcastle University. In just over a decade we have become a world-leading research group working at the cutting edge of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Design Futures and Digital Social Innovation.

Listen as we delve into the grand challenges of social and environmental sustainability, and future living, through the design of innovative digital technologies.
